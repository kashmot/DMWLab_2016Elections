# DMWLab_2016Elections
DMW Lab Project with LT4 Term 2 (Joaquin Gonzales, Weddy Diamada, K-Ann Carandang, Manu Gaspar and John Gacal).

Executive Summary
The 2016 national elections saw the highest voter turnout for the Philippines since 1986. Considered widely as the strongest vote of confidence for President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo, the extent of their wins has only been explained in terms of their geographical bailiwicks (“baluarte”). However, this study extends the definition of baluartes from mere geographic barriers into voter profiles (the “Study”). We also explored the characteristics of these bailiwicks especially in terms of (1) voter turnout or the level of voting participation of a particular region and (2) number of registered voters in an area. These numbers largely define the outcome of the elections for a candidate.
